## Contributing to Paynow React

Thanks for being interested in contributing! We're so glad you want to help!

We want contributing to Paynow React to be enjoyable and educational for anyone and everyone. All contributions are welcome, including: issues, new docs, as well as updates and tweaks, blog posts, workshops, and more.

Please note that we have a code of conduct. Please follow it in all of your interactions with the project and our community.

## Getting started

Please create a new branch from an up to date master on your fork. (Note: urgent hotfixes should be branched off the latest stable release rather than master)

- Fork the Paynow React repository on Github

- Clone your fork to your local machine git clone git@github.com:<yourname>/paynow-react.git
- Create a branch git checkout -b my-feature-branch
- Make your changes, lint, then push to GitHub with git push --set-upstream origin my-feature-branch.
- Visit GitHub and make your pull request.

If you have an existing local repository, please update it before you start, to minimise the chance of merge conflicts.

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:paynow-react/paynow-react.git
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```
